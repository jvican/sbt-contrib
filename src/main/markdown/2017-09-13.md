This is good to go.

## sbt validator

scripted causes

```
java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector to org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ContextSelector
https://www.sanesee.com/article/log4j2-async-logger-context-selector-cast-error
```

It shouldn't be fatal.
Waiting on flag.

### Dale's script is failing

The nightly uses Dbuild, but we might keep the script fresh.
