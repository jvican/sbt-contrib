## sbt 1.0 launch events

Yesterday, Dale hosted meetup in London.
Not too many people showed up.

Another one planned at Scala World

### plugin upgrades

- sbt-dependency-graph is almost done, WartRemover is merged.
- sbt-dependency-check checks for broken dependencies and warn you. It's also upgraded to sbt 1.

## State of Travis CI and Zinc

1.x branch fails on a bunch of tests (mostly the same ones).
We are disabling the failing tests for now so we can resume PR merging.

## 0.13.17 / 1.0.x

- Classpath bug - 0.13.16
- addSbtPlugin fix  #3393
- += for watchSource sbt/sbt#3439 
- NPE in logger. Registration of String format. - https://github.com/sbt/util/issues/119 
- Some other NPE. okhttp3.JavaNetAuthenticator.authenticate(JavaNetAuthenticator.java:37)
- Resolver bug - sbt/sbt#3451 (now closed)

Dale out till September 4th.

## Specific bugs

- scripted compiles bridge every time https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3469

## scripted test using Maven semantics

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3381
use publishM2 and include ~/.m2 to resolver when running scripted tests.

## CI

### Toni

We are stuck compiling. We can compile without proxy.

Compiling IO using repository proxy crashes.
