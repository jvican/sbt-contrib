## 1.0.2

1.0.2 is released.
<http://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2017-09-19-sbt-1-migration-status-and-1-0-2-hotfix/>

- Adds JVM flag `sbt.gigahorse` to enable/disable the internal use of Gigahorse to workaround NPE in JavaNetAuthenticator when used in conjunction with repositories override.
- Adds JVM flag `sbt.server.autostart` to enable/disable the automatic starting of sbt server with the sbt shell. This also adds new startServer command to manually start the server.

## 1.0.3

- Regression: extraJar vs allJar problem in ScalaInstance - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3561

## 1.1.0

- Unix permission <https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/76>
- client-server dicovery <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3556>
- token
- language server - <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3524>
- once server migrates to JSON-RPC, we should publish the spec
- migrate thin client to JSON-RPC based protocol
- slash syntax

### abiVersion

<https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3562>. Uses the fewest segment of the lowest version number that is binary compatible. For example, `Some("2")` for strict semver. `Some("2.3")` for Akka 2.3+.

The idea of allowing library authors to declare version semantics has been brought up
several times before. This one is directly in response to <https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/a-guide-on-binary-compatibility-need-your-input/1089/29>.

## scripted with Maven semantics

During testing we should use Maven semantics (nearest wins), and not rely on Ivy semantics via `publishLocal`.

## CI for realz

- 1.0.x needs to be merged into 1.x
- Akka might migrate to sbt 1
