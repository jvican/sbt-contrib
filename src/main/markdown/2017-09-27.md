## 1.0.3

It has several fixes already merged.
This could go out soon.

Toni to look into sbt 1.0.2 vs 0.13.16: different test TaskDefs <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3583>

## 1.1.0

sbt 1.1.0 RC-1 target date: October 11th.

Eugene: The current 1.1.0 milestone contains all sorts of hopes and dreams, but we should narrow it down.
Dale: We'll timebox and get whatever we can.

The rest of the meeting was discussion around items in https://github.com/sbt/sbt/milestone/24

### lsp (VS Code integration)

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3524
keep working on it. getting close.

### Unified slash syntax

almost ready

### Investigate scripted

Bug investigation:
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3545
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3545

likely related to `bgRun`

### default to ParallelGC (for Java 9)

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3559
Easy fix, and good task to work on.
Assigned to Mike.

### SLF4J log level is only error

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3398
Also good task to work on.

### cancelable in Global := true

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3252

Encouraging comment on the issue:

> So it's a 1% no-difference, 99% strict-improvement.

### sbt new creates litter target dir

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2835
There are some workaround we can probably do here.
Good task to work on.

### CI for Windows

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3568
We should add AppVeyor CI integration.

### abiVersion

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3562
This task is a bit more complicated, but it's something potentially someone could contribute.

### compile:clean

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3542
This also looks like an easier task if someone wants to contribute.

### Start up time in sbt 1.0.0-RC2 is slower

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3344
Worthy of investigation, but likely it won't happen soon.

### Add scripted as library dependency for builds of sbt plugins

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3538
Generally in support of the proposal.
Note that we cannot dynamically add plugins into metabuild, so we'd need to have `SbtPlugin` plugin a dependency of sbt mothership, and let the user enable it on a subproject.

### Cache publishing in sbt

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3548
Neutral.

### Reconsider failing `.value` inside lambda expression

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3266
Eugene wants to remove this validation. Dale thinks it's about how severe the side effect is for tasks (like publishing).

Taking hint from [SIP-18](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/modularizing-language-features.html), we can make implicit values for these features so we can opt out.

```scala
import sbt.dsl.valueInLambda
```

### literal `import` as project id

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3464
Eugene: Not really high priority.


We talked about more issues, but I am running out of time to take notes
