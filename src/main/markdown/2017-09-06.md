## ClassToAPI (canonical vs fully qualified name)

To be continued.
We just need to make sure we see things as JVM would.
Canonical probably won't matter for Zinc.

## Remove OkHTTP OkUrlFactory

Should go into 1.0.2.
Test scripted locally.

## Fix ConsoleInterface

Should go into 1.0.2.

## sever "change"

First it might require IO addition.

## sbt/sbt#3458 Classpath bug

Dale is still working on it.

## Runtime dir

sbt/sbt#3425

## Toni

Found potential breakage when compiling all 1.x.
Toni to file issue.

## 1.0.2

Let's target Friday, 2017-9-8.

## 1.1.0

I am ok postponing this for now since we are focusing on hot fixes.
No scheduled date.

## CI for reals

Toni: Building sbt takes 2h with Dbuild because Artifactory proxying doesn't work.
Eugene: There's an option to not use Gigahorse, if that's causing issue.

We have GitHub organization https://github.com/sbt-sandbox, which could be used to fork community libraries to upgrade to 1.x together. This could be used for testing sbt 1.0.x.
